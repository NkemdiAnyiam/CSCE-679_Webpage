This webpage is just an assignment from the CSCE 679 class Data Visualization at Texas A&M (Fall 2021). The instructions were as follows:

"Create a personal web page for this class. It will be where you place links to other writings/work you do during the semester. On this page you need to include your name, a photo of yourself, and a brief statement on why you are in this class.

Also identify (link to) one data visualization that you find particularly helpful/insightful and explain why you think this is so.

Finally, identify (link to) one data visualization that you find is particularly bad/unhelpful in some way. Explain why it is lacking -- maybe it encourages a misunderstanding of the data, is hard to understand, or has serious graphical design flaws."
